# Quantum-Repeater-Design

With a focus on Heralded Quantum Purification (HEP) protocols

We assume that the repeater network operates on optical fibre communication links, though free-space satellite to ground links also employ the same concepts of a quantum repeater.

## Objectives

### Main Objective

To design and implement a modern quantum repeater infrastructure for future quantum communication technologies and teleportation application.

### Specific Objectives

* [ ] To design and implement a complete quantum circuit of a quantum repeater whose executions emulate its expected workings and behaviour in a real world quantum network.
* [ ] Explore various purification strategies to identify the optimum strategy.
* [ ] Perform optimizations on the purification circuits and studying the effects of various purification protocols on the overall purification optimization scheme.
