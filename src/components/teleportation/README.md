# Quantum Teleportation

## Simulated Quantum Teleportation

Demonstrating and verifying the teleportation of a single qubit using IBM Qiskit simulation.

The full circuit is as seen below. The [quantum circuit code](../teleportation/teleportation_qubit_sim.ipynb) is in the jupyter notebook.

## Teleportation on a Real Quantum Computer

### Deferred Measurement

IBM hardware does not currently support instructions after measurements.

## Teleportation of Entanglement

Demonstrating and verifying the teleportation of an entangled pair using IBM Qiskit simulation.
