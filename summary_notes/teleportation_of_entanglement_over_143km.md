Teleportation of Entanglement Over 143 km

---
Presents a free-space entanglement swapping experiment.

---


Unique solution for future global quantum network - ```entanglement swapping``` i.e. teleportation of an entangled state; which is central to relaying entanglement between nodes.

Main components of quantum repeaters:

* Quantum entanglement switching - swapping entanglement between adjacent nodes to extend to the whole distance
* Quantum entanglement purification - enhance efficiency and fidelity of protocol
* Quantum memories - store quantum states for on demand retrieval.

Limitations of quantum repeaters:

* Imperfections of the source of entangled particles
* Imperfections of quantum operations involved
* Imperfections of interconnecting quantum channels

#### Procedure

Stations: 0, 1, 2, 3
Produce 2 entangled pairs:

* photons "0" and "1" - $\ket{\Psi^-}_{01}$
* photons "2" and "3" - $\ket{\Psi^-}_{23}$

This is a 4-qubit quantum system whose product state is: $\ket{\Psi} _{0123} = \ket{\Psi^-} _{01} \otimes \ket{\Psi^-} _{23}$

BMS between photons "1" and "2" results randomly in one of the four maximally entangled Bell states: $\ket{\Psi^\pm}$ and $\ket{\Phi^\pm}$ with an equal probability of 0.25.

BSM measurement projects photons "0" and "3" into entanglement just like photons "1" and "2".

Entanglement is swapped from "0-1" and "2-3" to "0-3" and "1-2".

Using linear optics allows distinguishing 2 out of 4 Bell states and provides maximum fidelity of 1.

### Experiment

Utilized a 143 km horizontal free-space link.

Individual polarization-entangled photon pairs generated via Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) in a nonlinear $\beta$-barium borate (BBO) crystal.

photons "0" and "3" simultaneously projected into the states: $\ket{\Psi^-} _{03}$ and
$\ket{\Psi^+} _{03}$, respectively.
