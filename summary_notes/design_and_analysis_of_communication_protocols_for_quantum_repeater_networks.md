[Design and Analysis of Communication Protocols for Quantum Repeater Networks](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/18/8/083015)

---

Analyze how the performance of a quantum repeater network depends on the protocol employed to ditribute entanglement. Develop numerical simulations of quantum networks using different protocols.

---

__Purpose and scope__: designing communication protocol between 2 neighbouring repeater nodes n order to maximize network performance.

__Assumption__: repeaters are connected with optical fibre.


### Conclusion

Bennet et al. showed that one-way communication is impossible if probability of qubit loss is 50% or greater.

Compared to alternatives, two-way protocols with loss heralding require less device complexity and can function even in settings with greater than 50% loss probability, making them suitable for near-term quantum repeater technology.
