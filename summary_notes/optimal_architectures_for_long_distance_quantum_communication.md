__Loss errors__ can be suppressed by either heralded entangleent generation (HEG) or quantum error correction (QEC). HEG requires two-way classical signalling as confirmation of success.

__Operation errors__ may be suppressed using heralded entanglement purification (HEP) or QEC.

### Conclusions

HEP is needed at higher levels of entanglement extensions to overcome operation errors.

Consider 2 widely used entanglement purification protocols:

* Deutsch et al.
* Dur et al.

The Deutsch protocol reaches higher fidelities with fewer rounds of purification. The Dur protocol saves on qubit resources.

> In general, despite differences in experimental requirements and efficiencies, the choice of purification protocols will not affect the big picture of scheme optimizaton.
