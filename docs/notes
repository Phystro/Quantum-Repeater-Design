Quantum repeaters are devices that are used to extend the range of quantum communication systems. They work by breaking up the communication channel into smaller segments, transmitting the quantum state over each segment, and then using entanglement swapping to reconnect the segments at the other end. This allows the quantum state to be transmitted over longer distances than would be possible with a single stretch of communication channel.
