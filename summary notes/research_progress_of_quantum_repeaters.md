Main components of quantum repeaters: __`quantum memories`__, __`quantum entanglement switching`__ and __`quantum entanglement purification`__.

### Development status
In principle, quantum repeater can be used to make distributed quantum entanglement pair decay polynomially with channel length, as opposed to the normal exponential decay/attenuation.

The main function of the quantum repeater is to extract the transmitted quantum state information, enhance the fidelity of the quantum state and transfer the measured quantum state to the next user.

Measuring quantum states causes their collapse.
> The more information is obtained by measureing quantum states, the greater the disturbance to the transmitted quantum states. _It is important to study the information disturbance balance of quantumm repeaters_.

Only quantum multiplexer-based quantum cryptography can truly realize
long-distance quantum communication.
> Multiplexing is a method used by networks to consolidate multiple signals -- digital or analog -- into a single composite signal that is transported over a common medium, such as a fiber optic cable or radio wave.

Entanglement purification techniques improve fidelity to communication threshold requirements.

The entanglement distribution and purification are completely probabilistic. The higher the probability of success the better. If either techniques fail at any segemnt, they only need to be repeated at said segment alone till success is achieved and the process can proceed. 

Quantum memories are used to store entangled states at each node. They counter the synchronization issue - helping store the states till a successful distribution or swapping in other nodes.
