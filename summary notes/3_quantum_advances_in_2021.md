### Multi-node quantum network

QuTech researchers successfully built a 3-node quantum network using entanglement swapping. 

They demonstrated entanglement swapping in a 3 node network.

They further demonstrated multipartite entanglement between all three nodes -creating a truly shared state among all three nodes.


### Solid-state quantum repeater

Researchers demonstrated heralded entanglement using multiplexed solid-state quantum memories. Network connected only two nodes.

They noted the need for quantum repeaters to `produce entanglement at high rates`, `with telecom wavelength` and `with long storage times`. The Solid-state memories they used achieve all the above goals, including the ability to store 62 temporal modes. THe nodes were separated by 50 metres and a bell state measurement node used to complete the heralded entanglement.


### Quantum repeater based on absorptive quantum memories

Researchers used 'absorptive' quantum memories which have the properties of `high bandwidth`, `high fidelity` and `multiplexing capacity`.

Researchers built a 2 node network separated by a heralding station.


### Conclusions
Researchers working towards practical implementations/components of quantum networks, across longer distances with `additional nodes`.
