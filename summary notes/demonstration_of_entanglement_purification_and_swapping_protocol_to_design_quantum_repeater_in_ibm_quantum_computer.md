[Demonstration of Entanglement Purification and Swapping Protocol to Design Quantum Repeater in IBM Quantum Computer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00854)

---

Mechanism of quantum communication lies in generating entangled states between distant parties. Quantum repeaters have been proposed to counter the long-distance challenge.

### Quantum repeaters
Generation and purification of entanglement for each segment and then transmission of the purified entanglement to the next segment through entanglement swapping.

QEC can be used in all generations of quantum repeaters as a purification protocol.

### Purification protocol
Noise si introduced into the channele to replicate loss and operation errors.

Purification protocol is choosen such that it can correct all types of errors in the noisy channel.

Purification scheme uses Hadamard (H) gates, phase gates (U1) and CNOT gates and more importantly, a single ancilla qubit to rectify the introduced errors. Protocol can be applied to any of the entangled channels.
