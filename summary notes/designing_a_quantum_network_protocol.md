### Entanglement distillation
Process through which 2 or more imperfect pairs are consumed to produce a higher fidelity pair with some finite probability. It is necessary to overcome poor quality links and fundamental loss of fidelity due to entanglement swapping which ultimately limits the achievable path length.

> ..is still an active open research question as to what the right distillation strategy is: as soon as link-pairs are generated, after every swap, after N swaps, at the ends only e.t.c.

There are many different methods available to perform distillation, each with its own trade-offs.
