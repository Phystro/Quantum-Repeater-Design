----
Quantum repeaters are the key to unlocking ability to transmit qubits over long distances, for a global quantum internet.

Ideas in classical repeaters can't be used in quantum repeaters:
* no-cloning theorem
* measurement of quantum states destroys them
* photons transmitted through fiber optic cables suffer from attenuation


### How quantum repeaters work:
Core idea is based on the idea of *entanglement swapping*. The primary goal of quantum networks is to distribute entanglement between members of the network.


### Entanglement swapping
Entanglement swapping uses teleportation to create long distance communication links from a chain of locally connected repeaters. Long distance entanglement is achieved from several short-distance entanglements.


### Why can't we build real quantum repeaters
First repeaters need to be designed to handle limitations of current devices. 


Types of errors:
* Loss errors
* Operation errors

Approaches to handle errors:
* Heralded Entanglement Generation (HEG)
* Heralded Entanglement Purification (HEP)
* Quantum Error Correction (QEC)

### Generations of Quantum Repeaters
They represent imporvements in quantum networks with increasingly powerful applications as technology improves.
#### 1st Gen
Apply *entanglement distillation* to handle errors - basically, one can get a high fidelity entanglement from many copies of low fidelity entanglement. Communication rate in such a network is limited by distillation process.
#### 2nd Gen
Rely on *quantum error correction* to handle operation errors. Network handles much higher speeds.
#### 3rd Gen
Improved quantum devices means *quantum error correction* will be used to handle both operation and loss errors. Much higher rate of communication.
